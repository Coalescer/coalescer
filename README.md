# Atelier Gouveia + Marques

Founded in 2023 by the architects **Marta Gouveia** and **Tonny Marques**, united by their architectural practice across different island contexts (the Azores and Madeira).  

Through imagination, the exploration of memories, the reading of distinct territories, and their individual experiences, they seek inspiration to shape a single body: **architecture**.  

This vision materializes in a collection of geographical records that support their daily work. Drawings, images, collages, and models at different scales reveal a project attitude that feels coherent and sincere towards place.

## Academic Background
Both architects studied at the **University of Évora (2017–2024)**, where their academic projects shaped much of their research and practice:

- **Marta Gouveia**  
  Dissertation: *“What can an island be”* (São Miguel)  
  Winner of the **Archiprix 2025 Prize**

- **Tonny Marques**  
  Dissertation: *“Picturesque Imaginary, Câmara de Lobos”* (Madeira)  
  Honorable Mention at the **Archiprix 2025 Prize**

These two readings of distinct territories convey unique atmospheres of different places, enriching their joint practice.
