  "TEXT": "The figure of the Mulher do Capote (Woman of the Cape), from São Miguel in the Azores, holds deep symbolic and cultural significance. The traditional female garment — consisting of a black cloak and a hood that concealed the face — is described by Raul Brandão as enigmatic, almost spectral, imprinting the island’s human landscape with a silent presence. According to the author, the capote was “made of a magnificent cloth that lasts a lifetime,” covering the body from the shoulders to the feet. The capelo, which enclosed the head, was lined with hemp to ensure firmness and was supported by a whalebone frame resting on the shoulders, giving it its distinctive shape.",
